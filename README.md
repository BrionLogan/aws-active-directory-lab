# 🖥️ AWS Active Directory Lab (Windows EC2)

This lab demonstrates provisioning **Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)** on an AWS Windows Server EC2 instance, promoting it to a **Domain Controller**, and creating basic user accounts.

---

## 0️⃣ Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- macOS device (lab done from Mac)
- Microsoft Remote Desktop installed
- RDP access allowed in AWS Security Group (my IP only)

---

## 1️⃣ Launch Windows Server EC2
- Chose **Windows Server 2019** AMI.
- Kept **default storage** for simplicity (enough for lab use).
- Kept **default VPC network** settings.
- Created a **new key pair** for RDP access.

**Reasoning:**  
Defaults speed up deployment, reduce configuration complexity, and avoid misconfiguring networking for a single-server lab.

---

## 2️⃣ Connect via RDP
- Downloaded the RDP file from AWS Console.
- Used key pair to decrypt Windows password in AWS Console.
- Connected via **Microsoft Remote Desktop** from Mac.

---

## 3️⃣ Install Active Directory Domain Services
- In **Server Manager → Add Roles and Features**:
  - Chose **Active Directory Domain Services**.
  - Accepted required features.

---

## 4️⃣ Promote to Domain Controller (New Forest)
- Clicked the **yellow triangle** in Server Manager → **Promote this server to a domain controller**.
- Chose **Add a new forest** → Domain: `mylab.local`.
- Left functional levels default, kept DNS/GC checked.
- Set DSRM password.

---

## 5️⃣ Verify Domain
- After reboot, logged in with `mylab\Administrator`.
- Confirmed domain in **Server Manager → Local Server**.

---

## 6️⃣ Create OUs and Users
- Opened **Active Directory Users and Computers (ADUC)**.
- Created OU:
  - `Users`
- Added 2 test users: `jdoe`, `jsmith`.

---

## 7️⃣ Proof This PC is in the Domain
- Verified in **System → About** that the machine is part of `mylab.local`.

---

## ✅ Lab Outcomes
- Installed AD DS on Windows Server EC2.
- Created a new forest and promoted the server to Domain Controller.
- Added an OU and test users.
- Verified the server is in the created domain.

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations
- RDP allowed **only** from my IP.
- Domain services not exposed to public internet.
- Default DNS and paths kept for lab simplicity.
